  <h1>Privacy Policy for Verdantoff</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 15 December 2025</p>

  <p>Verdantoff ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Verdantoff mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>
  <p>By using Verdantoff, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>To provide and improve our video communication service, we collect several types of information:</p>

  <h3>a) Information You Provide Directly</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, and a profile picture.</li>
    <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> With your explicit permission, we may access your device's contact list to help you connect with other users on Verdantoff.</li>
    <li><strong>User Content:</strong> The content of your video and audio communications. <strong>Critical Note:</strong> For standard peer-to-peer calls on Verdantoff, audio and video data is transmitted directly between users' devices and is not stored by us. For group calls or calls that require a server relay (e.g., to overcome connectivity issues), this data is temporarily processed on our secure servers but is not permanently recorded.</li>
    <li><strong>Customer Support:</strong> Any information you provide when you contact us for support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>b) Information Collected Automatically</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect data on how you interact with Verdantoff, such as call duration, frequency, features used, and diagnostic logs (time stamps, IP address, session events).</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Information about your mobile device, including the device model, operating system (Android) version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.</li>
    <li><strong>Call Diagnostics:</strong> Technical information related to call quality, such as connection times, bandwidth, packet loss, and resolution. This is necessary for troubleshooting and improving the Verdantoff service.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the core video calling functionality of Verdantoff.</li>
    <li>To authenticate your account and ensure the security of our service.</li>
    <li>To notify you about important service updates, incoming calls, or messages (with your consent where required by law).</li>
    <li>To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries.</li>
    <li>To monitor usage trends and analyze performance to enhance the App.</li>
    <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues, fraud, or abuse of Verdantoff.</li>
    <li>To comply with legal obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data Retention:</strong> We retain your account and profile information for as long as your Verdantoff account is active. Call content is not stored after a session ends. Technical logs are retained for a limited period necessary for security, fraud prevention, and App improvement.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, including encryption in transit (e.g., TLS and SRTP for video/audio streams). However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal data. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With Other Users:</strong> As necessary for the service to function (e.g., your profile name and video/audio stream to participants in your call).</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> With trusted third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting providers, analytics services, customer support platforms). These partners are expected to protect your data and use it only for the purposes we specify.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> If required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests by public authorities.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including access, correction, deletion, portability, restriction, objection, and withdrawing consent where applicable.</p>
  <p>To exercise these rights, contact us using the details below. We may need to verify your identity.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>

If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such information.</p>
