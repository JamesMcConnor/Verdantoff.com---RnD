Privacy Policy for Verdantoff
Last Updated: 15 December 2025
Verdantoff ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Verdantoff mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our App and the choices you have associated with that data.
By using Verdantoff, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
1. Information We Collect
To provide and improve our video communication service, we collect several types of information:
a) Information You Provide Directly:
    • Account Information: When you register, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, and a profile picture.
    • Contacts: With your explicit permission, we may access your device's contact list to help you connect with other users on Verdantoff.
    • User Content: The content of your video and audio communications. Critical Note: For standard peer-to-peer calls on Verdantoff, audio and video data is transmitted directly between users' devices and is not stored by us. For group calls or calls that require a server relay (e.g., to overcome connectivity issues), this data is temporarily processed on our secure servers but is not permanently recorded.
    • Customer Support: Any information you provide when you contact us for support.
b) Information Collected Automatically:
    • Usage Data: We collect data on how you interact with Verdantoff, such as call duration, frequency, features used, and diagnostic logs (time stamps, IP address, session events).
    • Device Information: Information about your mobile device, including the device model, operating system (Android) version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information.
    • Call Diagnostics: Technical information related to call quality, such as connection times, bandwidth, packet loss, and resolution. This is necessary for troubleshooting and improving the Verdantoff service.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected data for the following purposes:
    • To provide, maintain, and improve the core video calling functionality of Verdantoff.
    • To authenticate your account and ensure the security of our service.
    • To notify you about important service updates, incoming calls, or messages (with your consent where required by law).
    • To provide customer support and respond to your inquiries.
    • To monitor usage trends and analyze performance to enhance the App.
    • To detect, prevent, and address technical issues, fraud, or abuse of Verdantoff.
    • To comply with legal obligations.
3. Data Storage and Security
    • Data Retention: We retain your account and profile information for as long as your Verdantoff account is active. Call content is not stored after a session ends. Technical logs are retained for a limited period necessary for security, fraud prevention, and App improvement.
    • Security: The security of your data is paramount. We implement industry-standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. This includes encryption of data in transit (using protocols like TLS and SRTP for video/audio streams). However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell your personal data. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:
    • With Other Users: As necessary for the service to function (e.g., your profile name and video/audio stream to participants in your call).
    • Service Providers: With trusted third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (e.g., cloud hosting providers, analytics services, customer support platforms, payment processors). These partners are contractually bound to protect your data and use it solely for the purposes we specify.
    • Legal Requirements: If required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests by public authorities.
    • Business Transfers: In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.
5. Your Data Protection Rights
Depending on your location, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:
    • Access, Correction, or Deletion: You can access, update, or request deletion of your personal data directly within your Verdantoff account settings or by contacting us.
    • Data Portability: The right to receive a copy of your information in a structured, machine-readable format.
    • Restrict Processing & Object: You may have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your information or to object to certain processing.
    • Withdraw Consent: Where we rely on your consent (e.g., for accessing contacts), you can withdraw it at any time in your device or App settings.
To exercise these rights, please contact us at the details below. We may need to verify your identity before processing your request.
6. Children's Privacy
Verdantoff is not intended for individuals under the age of 13 (or the higher age of digital consent in your country). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to delete such information.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this policy periodically for any changes.
